The Debian Package rmsgw
----------------------------

This version is a modified version of the Github project found at:
https://github.com/nwdigitalradio/rmsgw

It re-arranges the source code in to proper directorys, updates to
current autotools, corrects build dependencies, and adds some bug fixes.

***Building a Debian Package***

To build a Debian (Ubuntu) package from this source tarball, you will need
the following additional packages installed:
        libtool
        dpkg-dev
        debhelper
        devscripts
        fakeroot
        lintian
        dh-make

From inside the source folder (rmsgw), run the following:
        ./autogen.sh
        debuild -us -uc

That should build a set of un-signed packages (.deb) in the parent folder.

To clean up/start over, the following commands are useful:
        fakeroot debian/rules clean
        ./autogen.sh clean

Note, you can build a package on a Pi if you want to make armhf packages 
instead (or do it in a cross-compiler, if you like).
